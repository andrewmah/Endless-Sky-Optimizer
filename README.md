# Endless-Sky-Optimizer
Endless Sky (https://endless-sky.github.io/) is an open source space exploration game. Your ship has energy generation and storage which is used to power your equipment. Using your equipment generates heat and if you overheat, your ship shuts down. This program finds the optimal equipment for the limited space on your ship to maximize your ship's energy generation while keeping your heat low enough that your ship will never overheat.

Run "python3 endlessSkyOptimizer.py" to run the program. There is already an example loaded. To run for your own ship, change the variables "ship_name" and "pre_outfits" at the bottom of endlessSkyOptimizer.py. "ship_name" controls the model of ship, and "pre_outfits" controls what other equipment you want installed on your ship besides energy and cooling (e.g. weapons, hyperdrive, engines).

You can convert cargo space on your ship into equipment space by installing "outfits expansions." Installing these affects the the heat of your ship in a more complicated way such that they can't be treated like other equipment. By default the program runs a search for every number of outfits expansions you could have installed just to show you all your options. If you want it to run for only the outfits you have specified, at the bottom of endlessSkyOptimizer.py uncomment the line with "single_search" and comment the line with "full_expansion_sweep."
